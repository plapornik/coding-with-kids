Coding with kids can be a *great* way to not only teach them some skills that will help them with their own lives, but also *create or strengthen* some lasting **bonds between you and them.**

Throughout your journey you will both likely learn new ``concepts`` and ``terms`` that will expand your horizons and provide hours of enjoyment.

  Some kids have problems with screen time and if you leave them unattended with a screen and they have access to things like YouTube or games, they may not stay focused on the task at hand.
